### To install on your CS lab machine acount:
  Copy the 'fuel'->'app_project' folder to your 'fuel' folder --> should now   
  have both an 'app' folder and an 'app_project' folder.   
  Copy the 'local'->'m1' folder to your 'local_html' folder.

  To run a copy locally, if you are running linux, navigate to the   
  'm1' folder in your 'local_host' directory and run: php -S localhost:8000
